Mini project proposal
Posted on: Monday, April 14, 2025 12:21:23 PM CDT

Dear all,

We have presentation of mini-project proposal in Friday's class.

Please pick any short ML problem of your choice.

The presentation should include the following:

1. Project Title:

2. Objective:

3. Problem Statement:

4. Dataset:
We will use the Student Performance Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or similar datasets that contain features like:

Gender

Age

Study time

Failures

Family support

Absences

Final grade

5. Tools & Technologies:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib/Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

6. Algorithms to be Used:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

7. Methodology:

Data collection and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature selection and engineering

Model training and testing

Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, RMSE, and RÂ² score

Result visualization and interpretation

8. Expected Outcome:
A well-performing ML model that can accurately predict a student's performance, along with a dashboard or charts showing key contributing factors.
